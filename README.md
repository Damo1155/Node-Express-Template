# Installation Details

- Fork this project into a new repository
- Adjust the following `package.json` fields in the new repository
    - `name`
    - `description`
    - `license`
    - `repository`
    - `author`
- Install all the packages using NPM or YARN
    - If YARN is not installed run the following commands
        - npm install -g yarn
        - yarn -v
            - Should return a version number
        - yarn
- Run the application from the new directory using NPM or YARN
    - yarn yarn:start
    - npm run npm:start
    - Feel free to rename/remove these where appropriate
- Make a test call to the `default` and `test` API to ensure the calls are working

# Future Improvements

- Tooling like DependaBot/Renovate to keep packages up to date.
- Integrate Nodemon for development environments.
- Remove ability to allow relative paths, ensure only absolute paths are used.
- Integrate Process ENV Constants so configuration can be managed by deployment pipelines.
- Lockdown core branches so accidental pushes cannot be committed back to this repository.
